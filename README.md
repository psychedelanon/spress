## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
TELE_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
PUBLIC_URL=your_deployment_url
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
WEBAPP_URL=https://yourapp.com/webapp
METRICS_PORT=9000
ENABLE_SHARE_HOOK=0
```

`PUBLIC_URL` **must** match the public domain of your deployment (for example
`https://mychess.fly.dev`). The server listens on `PORT` (3000 by default), so
your hosting provider needs to route traffic to this port.

On Fly.io, add the following services to `fly.toml`:
```toml
[[services]]
  internal_port = 3000
  protocol = "tcp"
  [[services.ports]]
    port = 80
    handlers = ["http"]
  [[services.ports]]
    port = 443
    handlers = ["tls", "http"]

[[services]]
  internal_port = 9000
  protocol = "tcp"
  [[services.ports]]
    port = 9000
    handlers = ["http"]
```


### Persistent Storage
When `/data` exists, the server stores games in a SQLite database at
`/data/games.db`. Mount this path as a volume so games persist after container
restarts. Example `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  spress:
    volumes:
      - spress_data:/data

volumes:
  spress_data:
```

For `docker run`, append `-v spress_data:/data`.

### Optional: Board Image Support
Install the [`chess-image-generator`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chess-image-generator) package if
you want inline "Show Board" buttons to reply with PNG chessboards. Without it the bot falls back to
an ASCII board.

### Bot Setup
1. Create a bot with @BotFather on Telegram
2. Set bot commands via BotFather:
   ```
   start - Welcome message
   solo - Play vs AI
   new - Challenge a friend  
   resign - Resign current game
   help - Show help
   ```
3. Configure webhook URL (optional): `https://yourapp.com/bot`

## üì± Mini App Integration

The chess board opens as a Telegram Web App with:
- Full-screen immersive experience
- Touch-optimized controls
- Real-time game state synchronization
- Telegram theme integration
- Haptic feedback support

When opened without a `session` parameter, the webapp now automatically
retrieves the user's active game. It calls the `/api/session` endpoint,
which returns the last active session ID stored for that Telegram user.
The bot records this mapping whenever a new game is created.

### Troubleshooting Telegram Mini Apps

- **Blank screen on Android** ‚Äì ensure your server provides the **full SSL
  certificate chain**. Serving only the leaf certificate can cause Telegram‚Äôs
  Android webview to block the request entirely.
- **Stuck loading** ‚Äì some Telegram versions (for example v10.2.2 on Android)
  had bugs preventing mini apps from launching. Updating the Telegram client
  typically resolves this.

## üéØ Future Enhancements

- [ ] Move history display
- [ ] Game analysis and hints
- [ ] Multiple difficulty levels
- [ ] Tournament brackets
- [ ] Player statistics
