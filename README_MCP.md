Validates if a move is legal in a given position:
```json
{
  "fen": "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1",
  "move": "e4"
}
```

**Returns**: Move validation result with new position and game state.

```json
{
  "playerRating": 1500,
  "opponentRating": 1600,
  "result": "win",
  "kFactor": 32
}
```

**Returns**: Expected score, actual score, rating change, and new rating.

### `get_opening_suggestions`
Provides opening suggestions based on current position:
```json

## üîß Configuration Details

### **MCP Configuration File**
Located at `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"],
      "env": {}
    },
    "git": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-git"],
      "env": {}
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_SERVER_FILESYSTEM_ROOT": "."
      }
    },
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_SERVER_MEMORY_PATH": "./.cursor/memory"
      }
    },
    "docs": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-docs"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_SERVER_DOCS_SOURCES": "https://react.dev/reference,https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs,https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js,https://socket.io/docs/v4,https://telegraf.js.org"
      }
    },
    "database": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sqlite"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_SERVER_SQLITE_PATH": "./data/chess.db"
      }
    },
    "chess": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./scripts/chess-mcp-server.js"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### **Memory Storage**
Project-specific memory is stored in `.cursor/memory/`. This includes:
- Coding patterns and decisions
- Architecture choices
- Performance optimizations
- Testing strategies

### **Database Access**
The database server connects to `./data/chess.db` and provides read-only access for safety.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### **Server Not Responding**
1. Check Cursor's Output panel ‚Üí MCP logs
2. Verify the server packages are available via npx
3. Restart Cursor to reload MCP configuration
4. Run the test script: `node scripts/test-chess-mcp.js`

### **Memory Issues**
- Memory files are stored in `.cursor/memory/`
- Clear memory by deleting files in this directory
- Memory is project-specific and persists across sessions

### **Database Access**
- Ensure the database file exists at `./data/chess.db`
- The AI can only perform read operations for safety
- Schema changes should be done manually

### **Chess Server Issues**
- Verify chess.js is installed: `npm install chess.js`
- Check the server logs in Cursor's Output panel
- Run the test script to verify functionality

## üìà Best Practices

### **1. Leverage Sequential Thinking**
For complex features, ask the AI to:
1. Plan the implementation
2. Break it into steps
3. Execute each step
4. Verify the result

### **2. Use Memory for Consistency**
Store important decisions about:
- Code architecture patterns
- API design choices
- Testing strategies
- Performance optimizations

### **3. Combine Multiple Servers**
- Use docs server for API references
- Use git server to understand existing code
- Use memory server to maintain consistency
- Use database server to understand data flow
- Use chess server for game-specific logic

### **4. Project-Specific Context**
The AI now has access to:
- Your chess game logic and rules
- Telegram bot integration patterns
- React component structure
- Database schema and relationships
- Chess-specific analysis tools
